# Bookie

## This is a site for book lovers, where they can add book reviews and see the list of my favourite ones.

  Here's the [link](http://brutuseti.pythonanywhere.com/) to this site.

### What tools were used to make this site?

  Site is built on Flask framework using python and is used basic HTML/CSS, Parsing, Flash function as well as many other and SQLAlchemy for storing data like hashed passwords
and reviews.

### What are the problems users may find?

  You may encounter some problems as you are trying to access pages like My profile, Recommendations and Reviews, because you can't do that without 
registration and authorization.
